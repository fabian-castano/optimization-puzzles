On October 5 2024 Meinoff Sellman published an optimization puzzle on Linkedin that caught my attention.

The puzzle was about finding the optimal solution for a simple non-linear optimization problem. The problem was to find the optimal values for x and y that minimize the following function:

$\min : f(x, y,z,u,v) = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{xy} + \frac{1}{xyz} + \frac{1}{xyzu} + \frac{1}{xyzuv}$

Subject to the following constraints:

$g(x, y, z, u, v) = x + y + z + u + v = 5$
